            <p>"Personal Information" refers to information that identifies you or another person. This may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Information you provide when you use login services (e.g., Google or Apple), such as your UID (Unique Identifier) and email address. This data is used only to authenticate your account and is not shared with third-party advertisers.</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>2.2 Non-Personal Information</h3>

            <p>
                Any images captured within the app (e.g., for pill scanning and counting) are processed entirely on your device. They are not uploaded, shared externally, or permanently stored. All image processing is done temporarily and locally to ensure privacy and safety.
